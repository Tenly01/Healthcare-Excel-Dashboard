# Healthcare Revenue & Patient Insights Dashboard

##  Goal
Support management in improving revenue collection and patient satisfaction by analyzing billing, demographics, and revenue trends.

##  Tools & Methods
- **Excel**: data cleaning, analysis, dashboard design
- **Data Prep**: removed duplicates, corrected data types, handled missing values, added helper columns, standardized demographics
- **Dashboard Features**: KPIs, interactive slicers (Year, Payment Status, Visit Type), demographic charts, trend analysis, data flags

##  Key Insights
- **Low Collection Rate**: Only 19.7% of $504.4K billing collected → $405.1K (80%) outstanding
- **Data Quality Issues**: Missing payment status & unknown demographics reduce reporting reliability
- **Trends**: No seasonal pattern — 2024 and 2025 show inverse monthly performance
- **Top Patients**: Billing distributed fairly evenly ($992–$1,151.1), no over-reliance on one patient

##  Recommendations
1. Strengthen billing & collection (timely billing, follow-ups, insurance claims)
2. Enforce complete payment status and demographic capture at registration
3. Investigate non-seasonal performance drivers (campaigns, staffing, services)
4. Maintain consistent engagement with high-billing patients

##  Value Delivered
- Clear view of revenue leakage
- Actionable insights to improve data capture & collection efficiency
- Interactive dashboard enabling drill-down by year, payment status, and visit type
